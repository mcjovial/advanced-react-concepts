// Lazy loading and code splitting in React allow you to load components or other assets only when they are needed, 
// instead of including them in the initial bundle.This helps improve the initial page load performance by 
// reducing the bundle size and deferring the loading of less critical resources.

// Here's an example that illustrates the usage of lazy loading and code splitting using the React.lazy function:
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy loaded component
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

// Parent component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Lazy Loading and Code Splitting Example</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

// In this example, the React.lazy function is used to lazily load the LazyComponent when it is needed. 
// The import() function dynamically imports the component module from the specified file path.
// The Suspense component is used to wrap the lazy - loaded component and provide a fallback UI, such 
// as a loading spinner or message, while the component is being loaded.

// When the LazyComponent is accessed or rendered, it will be loaded asynchronously, and the fallback 
// UI will be displayed until the component is fully loaded.This helps avoid delaying the initial page load and 
// improves the user experience by loading only the required components when they are needed.

// It's important to note that lazy loading and code splitting can be applied not only to components but also 
// to other assets such as images, stylesheets, or JavaScript modules.By splitting your code into smaller, 
// more manageable chunks, you can reduce the initial bundle size and load additional resources as needed, 
// improving the performance of your React application.

// It's worth mentioning that lazy loading and code splitting require a compatible build tool or bundler, 
// such as webpack, that supports these features.Additionally, it's important to consider the impact on the user 
// experience and ensure that the code splitting strategy aligns with the application's requirements and performance goals.
